# What's this
* A half-failed chimera of HTTP page renderer & API server (half-failed because it's half complete)
* Supplied with a logging scaffolding (i probably meant boilerplate)

# How to use
See / change `/src/utils/elevator.ts` for accurate locations
* Shove `.html` / `.mustache` to new folder `/pages` (`/pages/public` if it's to be seen)
* Shove things to `/assets`
* Cram endpoints to `/src/endpoints` (maybe? I dunno maybe I should do something to it)

K bye.ðŸ¥±
